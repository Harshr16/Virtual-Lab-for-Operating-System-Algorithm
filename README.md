We have made this website using html and css for frontend and javascript for backend.
This website helps user to have an overview of various disk scheduling algorithms and also simulate using the data entered by users.
It helps explore scheduling algorithms in a virtual lab that includes algorithms such as Round Robin , Bankers, SCAN/C-SCAN Disk Scheduling , and MPU Page Replacement.
We made this Virtual Lab in a group of 6.
